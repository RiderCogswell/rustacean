# Rustacean

## Description
Follow my journey through [The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html) by Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols, with contributions from the Rust Community. I have had a lot of fun learning Rust and recommend anyone who enjoys programming to dive in, and if anyone would like to work together on a project, I would be more than open!
